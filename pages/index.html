        <p>I have been on the internet for <script src="/js/dayssinceitstarted.js"></script> days!</p>

        <p>since then, i've learned..</p>
        <div class="card javascript">
            <ctitle>JavaScript</ctitle>
            <p>I used to really hate JavaScript back then because my dad hated it lol. But I learned about Node which also taught me es modules and etc which made it a lot more fun to use. I use JS as my main language now.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card html">
            <ctitle>HTML</ctitle>
            <p>I don't really use Node that much, and most of the stuff I make is a webapp. This is what you use to structure webapps.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <ctitle>CSS</ctitle>
            <p>My least favorite one! This one causes me so much pain and I mostly use ChatGPT for it. It took me around 20 minutes to design these cards because CSS is a pain.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card python">
            <ctitle>Python</ctitle>
            <p>I do not like Python either! But I have to use it for a lot of things. Its syntax is really weird.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card php">
            <ctitle>PHP</ctitle>
            <p>If you asked me a couple weeks ago I would've said I hated PHP. Ever since I learned about <a href="https://www.phprouter.com">php router</a> things have changed and i'm actually starting to enjoy it somehow. I enjoy it because I can easily deploy it to my website (it has really good PHP support).</p>
        </div>
        <p>and a lot of other programming languages (around 6 more i think)</p>
